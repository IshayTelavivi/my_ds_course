### Bunny Game
---------------

Building a video game!!

The game was given as an assignment in our DS course towards the end of the python section. Although gaming is not the focus of our course,
the assignment required the use of various tools we had learned during this section. The work on this assignment gave me a lot of knowledge 
about how a game is built, for example how an object moves (it doesn't actually move, it's being recreated), what is a rectangle and what
is it used for, how to render the screen etc. And of course knowledge about pygame and its documentaiton. 

A reference to a website with the game code was provided, however this code was written in very bad python. So the work was writing the 
code from scratch, putting what we had learned into practice. The reference can be found on the assignment instructions.

To write the game in 'good' pyhton, I did the following:
- Using modularity - arranging the code in functions and connecting between them
- Following DRY rules (don't repeat yourself)
- Detailing the game constants and variables, so these could be used per need easily
- Simplifying the code
- Adding comments
- Many other changes (for instance, including the arrow and badger's rectangles within the lists, adding a dictionary
  for the arrows etc.)
  
The folder contains:
* game_question (3).ipynb - a jupyter notebook where the instructions are specified, step by step
* bunny_assignment_for submissionv2.py - a py file with my code
* Some png files as game images
* Some wav files as game sounds
