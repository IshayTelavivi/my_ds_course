### Graphs Mini Project
------------------------

This mini project was assigned at the end of the python section in my data science course. Actually this was an optional assignment for those of us who wanted to get extra practice and meet this challenge. And it was challenging...
The focus of this mini project was practicing and designing mathematical graphs (node, edges etc.), both directional and non-directional ones. It involved also self learning of graphs algorithms (BFS, DFS), and their implementaiton in the code. Another aspect of this exercise was the use of object oriented programming and the creation of classes which we had learn just prior to this assignment.

This mini project was written in Pycharm.
