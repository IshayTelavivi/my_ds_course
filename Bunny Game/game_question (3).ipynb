    "The [solution](https://www.raywenderlich.com/24252/beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python) is in the internet. I advice you **not** to use it! You will **not** learn. Moreover, it's written by a 13 years old with very bad code style and code practice. It's **not** a best practice solution. If you copy you will learn bad coding practices.\n",

    "* `screen.fill(0)` - clear the screen (before drawing it again), notice it uses the screen variable\n",
    "* `screen.blit(object, where)` - draw an object on the screen.\n",
    "* `pygame.display.flip()` - update the screen after all the `blit`\n",
    "* `pygame.event.get()` - get a list of events from the user (e.g. mouse click, keyboard click etc)\n",
    "* `pygame.quit()` - quit the game.\n",

    "Task:\n",
    "1. Write a piece of code which:\n",

    " * setup the screen\n",
    " * loads the resource image `dude.png`\n",

    "# Step 3: Make the Bunny Move\n",
    "Next you need to add some actual gameplay elements, like making the bunny respond to key presses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, first you’ll implement a good method of keeping track of which keys are being pressed at a given moment. You can do this simply by making a data structure to keep the key states that holds the state of each key you want to use for the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code to game.py at the end of section #2 (after you set the screen height and width):\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the game will move the player to different positions, it’s easier to have a variable that contains the player position and then simply draw the player at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, update the key data structure based on which keys are being pressed. PyGame makes detecting key presses easy by adding event.key functions. When a key is pressedthe `event.type` equals `pygame.KEYDOWN` and when the key is up then `event.type` equals `pygame.KEYUP`. The value of the key will appear in `event.key`. Search pygame docs to discover what is the value of lef, right up and bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you check to see if a key is being pressed down or released. Then you check which key is being pressed or released, and if the key being pressed or released is one of the keys you’re using, you update the keys variable accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you need to update the player position variable in response to the key presses. This is actually very simple, simply checks which of the keys are being pressed and adds or subtracts from the player’s x or y position (depending on the key pressed) to move the player (use a varialbe `PLAYER_SPEED` to determine how much to add/substract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the game and you should get a player just like before. Try pressing the arrows keys. Yay! It works.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP: notice that if a key is down, the location of the play is updated in every game loop."

    "\n",
    "To know the angle of rotation, `import math` and use `math.atan2` on the difference between the bunny and mouse cursor location. Notice that `atan2` returns randians (2*pi is 360 degress)\n",

    "In order to turn the bunny's image use `pygame.transform.rotate` (notice `rotate` gets angles as input)\n",

    "Notice a confusing issue: since the rotation axis is the left-bottom (?) corner of the image, when the bunny be rotated, its position will change. You will need to correct this by using `bunny.get_rect().width` and `bunny.get_rect().hight` which help you find out how to adjust the bunny position so that it would look like the bunny rotates around the central axis.\n",
