### my_ds_course
---------
This is my first github repository! I made it following the tutorial video [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1702&v=SWYqp7iY_Tc).

My DS course has started on Dec 12 2017, and I am going to use this repository to store my exercises and other related material.
Our first topic of the course is Python programming. As we move along, I will manage the directory accordingly
