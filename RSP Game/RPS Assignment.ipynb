    "At the beginning the players are asked to write their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round the players are asked to type Rock / Scissors / Paper, and acoording to their choice , one of them wins. If the match comes up in a tie, the players are given another try, so that there must be a winner for each round. If the player types an error, the program asks to retype.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each round the players are asked whether they want to continue playing. Only if both want, the game continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the game ends, the program privides a game summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is composed of three functions:\n",
    "* one_round - the function generates one round of the game. The function takes no input (the input is within the function), and provides output as the winner's name and the guesses of both players.\n",
    "\n",
    "* count_games - the function counts the number of winning rounds, provides an intermediate score message and checks if the plaers want to continue. The output is number of rounds, the game winner, the guesses for each round and the intermediate score for each round.\n",
    "\n",
    "* show_game_summary - the function provides a game summary with three parts: winner of the whole game message, a table with rounds details, and a summary of numbers of wins per player.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not write a funtion to the names submission, to avoid a situation where an input is required whenever the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "I combined the whole code to one cell, so that it runs in one pulse. "
