These by-laws, the powers of the corporation and of its directors and stockholders, and all matters concerning the management of the business and conduct of the affairs of the corporation shall be subject to such provisions in regard thereto, if any, as are set forth in the certificate of incorporation; and the certificate of incorporation is hereby made a part of these by-laws.

ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held at nine-thirty o’clock in the forenoon on the first Monday in May in each year, unless that day be a legal holiday at the place where the meeting is to be held, in which case the meeting shall be held at the same hour on the next succeeding day not a legal holiday, or at such other date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which they shall elect a board of directors and transact such other business as may be required by law or these by-laws or as may be specified by the chairman of the board or by a majority of the directors then in office or by vote of the board of directors and of which notice was given in the notice of the meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first annual meeting of the corporation shall be held in the year 1999. \\n\\n3.2. SPECIAL MEETING IN PLACE OF ANNUAL MEETING. If the election for directors shall not be held on the day designated by these by-laws, the directors shall cause the election to be held as soon thereafter as convenient, and to that end, if the annual meeting is omitted on the day herein provided therefor or if the election of directors shall not be held thereat, a special meeting of the stockholders may be held in place of such omitted meeting or election, and any business transacted or election held at such special meeting shall have the same effect as if transacted or held at the annual meeting, and in such case all references in these by-laws to the annual meeting of the stockholders, or to the annual election of directors, shall be deemed to refer to or include such special meeting.

Such notice shall be given by the secretary, or by an officer or person designated by the board of directors, or in the case of a special meeting by the officer calling the meeting. As to any adjourned session of any meeting of stockholders, notice of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken except that if the adjournment is for more than thirty days or if after the adjournment a new record date is set for the adjourned session, notice of any such adjourned session of the meeting shall be given in the manner heretofore described. No notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjourned session thereof need be given to a stockholder if a written waiver of notice, executed before or after the meeting or such adjournment session by such stockholder is filed with the records of the meeting or if the stockholder attends such meeting without objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the stockholders or any adjourned session thereof need be specified in any written waiver of notice. \\n\\n3.6. QUORUM OF STOCKHOLDERS. At any meeting of the stockholders, whether the same be an original or an adjourned session, a quorum shall consist of a majority in interest of all stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, except in any case where a larger quorum is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present. \\n\\n3.7. ACTION BY VOTE. When a quorum is present at any meeting, whether the same be an original or an adjourned session, a plurality of the votes properly cast for election to any office shall elect to such office and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any question other than an election to an office shall decide the question, except when a larger vote is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election. \\n\\n3.8. ACTION WITHOUT MEETINGS. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders for or in connection with any corporate action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. \\n\\nIf action is taken by unanimous consent of stockholders, the writing or writings comprising such unanimous consent shall be filed with the records of the meetings of stockholders. \\n\\nIf action is taken by less than unanimous consent of stockholders and in accordance with the foregoing, there shall be filed with the records of the meetings of stockholders the writing or writings comprising such less than unanimous consent and a certificate signed and attested to by the secretary that prompt notice was given to all stockholders of the taking of such action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written consent. \\n\\nIn the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any of the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, if such action had been voted upon by the stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such provision shall state that written consent has been given under Section 228 of said General Corporation Law, in lieu of stating that the stockholders have voted upon the corporate action in question, if such last mentioned statement is required thereby. \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3.9. PROXY REPRESENTATION. Every stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a stockholder is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any meeting, objecting to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or by his attorney-in-fact or be authorized by such other means as is provided in Section 212 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally. The authorization of a proxy may but need not be limited to specified action, provided, however, that if a proxy limits its authorization to a meeting or meetings of stockholders, unless otherwise specifically provided such proxy shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjourned session but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof. \\n\\n3.10. VOTES PER SHARE. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. \\n\\n3.11.

Such list shall be open to examination by any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for at least ten days prior to the meeting either at the place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place should be specified in the notice of such meeting, or at the place where such meeting is to be held, and shall also be produced at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

VACANCIES. Vacancies and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors may be filled by vote of the stockholders at a meeting called for the purpose, or by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. When one or more directors shall resign from the board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote or action by writing thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective.

In the absence or \\n\\n* * *\\n\\ndisqualification of any member of such committee and his alternate, if any, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Except as the board of directors may otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but unless otherwise provided by the board or such rules, its business shall be conducted as nearly as may be in the same manner as is provided by these by-laws for the conduct of the business by the board of directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the board of directors upon request. \\n\\n4.6. REGULAR MEETINGS. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without call or notice at such place within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the board may from time to time determine, provided that notice of the first regular meeting following any such determination shall be given to absent directors.

Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as the act of the board or of such committee, as the case may be. \\n\\n4.12. COMPENSATION. In the discretion of the board of directors, each director may be paid such fees for his services as director and be reimbursed for his reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his duties as director as the board of directors from time to time may determine.

Dividends. \\n\\nWhenever the full dividends upon any outstanding Serial Preferred Shares for all past dividend periods shall have been paid and the full dividends thereon for the then current respective dividend periods shall have been paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the respective payments thereof set apart, the holders of the Common Shares shall be entitled to receive such dividends and distributions, payable in cash or otherwise, as may be declared thereon by the Board of Directors from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor. \\n\\n2\\\\. Rights on Liquidation. \\n\\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of theCorporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after the payment or setting apart for payment to the holders of any outstanding Serial Preferred Shares of the full preferential amounts to which such holders are entitled as herein provided or referred to, all of the remaining assets of the Corporation shall belong to and be distributable in equal amounts per share to the holders of the Common Shares.

Subject to the foregoing limitations, the number of Directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the Code of Regulations of the Corporation. In the event that the total number of Directors is not divisible by three, an extra Director shall be assigned to Class I if there is one extra Director to be assigned among the classes, and an extra director shall be assigned to each of Classes I and II if there are two extra Directors to be assigned among the classes. The Directors to be elected at each annual meeting of Shareholders shall be only the members of the class whose term of office then expires. The term of office of the initial Directors in each respective class shall be as follows: (a) Directors in Class I shall hold office until the annual meeting of Shareholders held in 2001; (b) Directors in Class II shall hold office until the annual meeting of Shareholders in 2002; and (c) Directors in Class III shall hold office until the annual meeting of Shareholders in 2003.

All of the Directors or all or the Directors of a particular class or any individual Director may be removed from office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors. Should a vacancy occur or be created, whether arising through death, resignation or removal of a Director or through an increase in the number of Directors, such vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote of the Directors then in office, or by the sole remaining Director if only one Director remains in office. A Director so elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the present term of office of the class to which he or she was elected. \\n\\nARTICLE VI \\n\\nThe Corporation may purchase, from time to time, and to the extent permitted by the laws of Ohio, shares of any class of stock issued by it. Such purchases may be made either in the open market or at private or public sale, and in such manner and amounts, from such holder or holders of outstanding shares of the Corporation and at such prices as the Board of Directors of \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nthe Corporation shall from time to time determine, and the Board of Directors is hereby empowered to authorized such purchases from time to time without any vote of the holders of any class of shares now or hereafter authorized and outstanding at the time of any such purchase. \\n\\nARTICLE VII \\n\\nThe preemptive right to purchase additional shares or any other securities of the Corporation is expressly denied to all shareholders of all classes. \\n\\nARTICLE VIII \\n\\nThe right of shareholders to vote cumulatively in the election of Directors of the Corporation is expressly denied to all shareholders of all classes. \\n\\nARTICLE IX \\n\\nIndemnification of Directors and Officers. \\n\\n(a) Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law, any Director or officer who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereafter, a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, non-profit or for-profit, a limited liability company, or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or inaction (including any actual or alleged error, misstatement or misleading statement) of such person while acting in an official capacity as a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Subsection (d) of this Article IX, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. \\n\\n(b) Indemnification of Employees and Agents. To the extent that an employee or agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Subsection (a) of this Article IX, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in the action, suit or proceeding. Any further indemnification of employees and agents shall occur only if and to the extent that the Directors may, in their discretion, so determine. \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n(c) Advancement of Expenses. Expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by a Director or officer of the Corporation in defending any proceeding referred to in Subsection (a) of this Article IX, shall be paid by the Corporation, in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director or officer to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article IX; which undertaking may be secured or unsecured, at the discretion of the Corporation. \\n\\n(d) Procedures and Presumptions Under This Article. If a claim under Subsection (a) of this Article IX is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Ohio General Corporation Laws for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its Shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Ohio General Corporation Laws, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its Shareholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. \\n\\n(e) Indemnification Provided In This Article Not Exclusive. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided under this Article IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, these Articles of Incorporation, the Code of Regulations, any agreement, any vote of Shareholders or any vote of disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in their official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. \\n\\n(f) Contractual Obligation. This Article IX shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Director or officer of the Corporation, each individual who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, a limited liability corporation, or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, who serves in such capacity at any time while this Article IX is in effect, and any repeal, amendment or other modification of this Article IX shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n(g) Savings Clause. If this Article IX or any portion thereof shall be invalidated or found unenforceable on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, excise taxes, penalties and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article IX that shall not have been invalidated or found unenforceable, or by any other applicable law. \\n\\n(h) Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and on behalf of any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or individual serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, a limited liability corporation, or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Ohio General Corporation Laws. \\n\\nARTICLE X \\n\\nNotwithstanding any provisions of the laws of the State of Ohio now or hereafter in force requiring for any action the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a designated proportion (but less than all) of the voting power of the Corporation or of any class or classes of shares thereof, such action may be taken by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Corporation or of such class or classes, except that the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting power of the Corporation or of such class or classes shall be necessary to adopt any amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation and except that no amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation shall be effective to amend, alter, repeal or change the effect of any of the provisions of Articles V, VII, VIII, IX, X or XI hereof unless such amendment shall receive the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent of the outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon and at least a majority of the Common Shares entitled to vote thereon held by shareholders none of whom is as of the record date fixed for such vote, a Related Person, affiliate of a Related Person, or an associate of a Related Person; provided, however, that such voting requirement shall not be applicable to the approval of such an amendment if such amendment shall have been proposed and authorized by action of a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Corporation. \\n\\nARTICLE XI \\n\\n1\\\\. Voting Requirements for Certain Business Combinations Involving a Related Person \\n\\n(a) In addition to the affirmative vote which may be required of the holders of any series of Preferred Shares which may then be outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation, which \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nshall include the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding Common Shares held by shareholders other than the “Related Person” (as hereinafter defined), shall be required for the approval or authorization of any “business combination” (as hereinafter defined) of the Corporation with any Related Person; provided, however, that such voting requirements shall not be applicable if the shareholders are asked to approve or authorize a particular business combination which has been authorized and proposed to the shareholders by action of the Board of Directors of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors then in office and by the affirmative vote of a majority of Disinterested Directors then in office, or if the shareholders are asked to approve or authorize a particular business combination as to which both of the following conditions are satisfied: \\n\\n(i) the aggregate amount of the cash and the fair market value of the consideration other than cash to be received per share by the holders of the Common Shares of the Corporation in such business combination is at least equal to the greater of (1) the highest price per share (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealer’s fees) paid or agreed to be paid by the Related Person to acquire beneficial ownership of any Common Shares (with appropriate adjustments for recapitalizations, and for stock splits, stock dividends and like distributions), (2) the highest price per share (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealer’s fees) paid by any person to acquire beneficial ownership of any Common Shares on the open market at any time during the twenty-four month period immediately prior to the taking of such vote, or (3) the per share book value of such Common Shares at the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the taking of such vote; and \\n\\n(ii) the consideration to be received by holders of Common Shares in such business combination shall be in the same form and of the same kind as the most favorable form and kind of consideration paid by the Related Person in acquiring beneficial ownership of any of the Common Shares already held, directly or indirectly, by it. \\n\\nThe determination of a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Corporation, made in good faith and based upon information known to them after reasonable inquiry, shall be conclusive as to all facts necessary for compliance with this Article, including without limitation (A) whether any person, partnership, corporation or firm is a Related Person or affiliate or associate as defined herein, and (B) the most favorable form and kind of consideration paid by the Related Person in acquiring beneficial ownership of Common Shares. \\n\\n2\\\\.

The registered office shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. \\n\\nSection 2. OTHER OFFICES. The corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors (the “Board”) may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require. \\n\\nARTICLE II.  \\nMEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS\\n\\nSection 1. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware designated by the Board.

The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and time designated by the Board. At each annual meeting directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted. \\n\\nSection 3. QUORUM; ADJOURNED MEETINGS AND NOTICE THEREOF. A majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of which are present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum, and the votes present may continue to transact business until adjournment. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the voting stock represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat. \\n\\nSection 4. VOTING. When a quorum is present at any meeting, in all matters other than the election of directors, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on a particular question shall decide such question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different \\n\\n1\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\nvote is required in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. \\n\\nSection 5. PROXIES. At each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder and bearing a date not more than three years prior to said meeting, unless said instrument provides for a longer period. All proxies must be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at the beginning of each meeting in order to be counted in any vote at the meeting. Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock having voting power, registered in his name on the books of the corporation on the record date set by the Board as provided in Article II, Section 8 hereof. \\n\\nSection 6. SPECIAL MEETINGS.

Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. \\n\\nSection 7. NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS’ MEETINGS. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given, which notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. The written notice of any meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. If mailed, notice is deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. \\n\\n2\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\nSection 8.

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date: (a) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; and (b) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. \\n\\nSection 9. NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS AND NOMINATIONS. \\n\\n(a) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (i) pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time notice provided for in this Section 9 is given to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures in this Section 9. \\n\\n(b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a) of this Section 9, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation, and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than sixty days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the earlier of (i) the day on which notice of the meeting was mailed or (ii) the date public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above. Such stockholder’s notice shall set forth: \\n\\n3\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\n(A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 14a-101 thereunder (including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (I) the name and address of such stockholder and of such beneficial owner, as they appear on the corporation’s books, (II) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (III) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination and (IV) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (y) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation’s outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (z) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder’s proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation. \\n\\n(c) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii) provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 9 is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation’s notice of meeting, if the stockholder’s notice required by paragraph (b) of this Section 9 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of \\n\\n4\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\n(i) the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or (ii) the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above. \\n\\n(d) (i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to serve as directors, and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder’s nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder’s representation as required by paragraph (b) of this Section 9) and (B) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 9, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. \\n\\n(ii) For purposes of this Section 9, “public announcement” shall include disclosure in a press release reported by PRNewswire, Business Wire, the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. \\n\\n(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9. Nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to affect any rights (A) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (B) of the holders of any series of preferred stock of the corporation to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. \\n\\n5\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\nSection 10.

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. \\n\\nSection 11. STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may not be taken without a meeting. \\n\\nARTICLE III.  \\nDIRECTORS\\n\\nSection 1. THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORS. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be not less than three nor more than fifteen. The actual number of directors shall be fixed from time to time solely by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors. The directors need not be stockholders. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article, and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified; provided, however, that unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or by law, any director or the entire Board may be removed, for cause, from the Board at any meeting of stockholders by not less than 66 2/3% of the outstanding stock of the Corporation. \\n\\nSection 2. VACANCIES. Vacancies on the Board by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled solely by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of the class to which such director shall have been elected. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office. \\n\\n6\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\nSection 3. POWERS. The property and business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board. In addition to the powers and authorities by these Bylaws expressly conferred upon them, the Board may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. \\n\\nSection 4. PLACE OF DIRECTORS’ MEETINGS. The directors may hold their meetings, have one or more offices and keep the books of the corporation outside of the State of Delaware. \\n\\nSection 5. REGULAR MEETINGS. Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board. \\n\\nSection 6. SPECIAL MEETINGS.

No such purchase or retirement shall be made if the capital of the Corporation would be impaired thereby.\\n\\nIf less than all the outstanding shares are to be redeemed, such redemption may be made by lot or pro rata as may be prescribed by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may alternatively invite from shareholders offers to the Corporation of Preferred Stock at less than an amount to be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors prior to issuance of such Preferred Stock, and when such offers are invited, the Board of Directors shall then be required to buy at the lowest price or prices offered, up to the amount to be purchased.\\n\\nFrom and after the date fixed in any such notice as the date of redemption (unless default shall be made by the Corporation in the payment of the redemption price), all dividends on the Preferred Stock thereby called for redemption shall cease to accrue and all rights of the holders thereof as stockholders of the Corporation, except the right to receive the redemption price, shall cease and terminate.\\n\\nAny purchase by the Corporation of the shares of its Preferred Stock shall not be made at prices in excess of said redemption price.\\n\\n5\\\\.

A majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. Except as otherwise provided by these Articles of Incorporation or the Colorado Business Corporation Act, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders. When, with respect to any action to be taken by shareholders of this Corporation, the laws of Colorado require the vote or concurrence of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares, of the shares entitled to vote thereon, or of any class or series, such action may be taken by the vote or concurrence of a majority of such shares or class or series thereof. Cumulative voting shall not be allowed in the election of directors of this Corporation.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nShares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no rights to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law, in which case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.

Once such areas of interest are delineated, all such business opportunities within such areas of interest which come to the attention of the officers, directors, and other members of management of this Corporation shall be disclosed promptly to this Corporation and made available to it. The board of directors may reject any business opportunity presented to it and thereafter any officer, director or other member of management may avail himself of such opportunity. Until such time as this Corporation, through its board of directors, has designated an area of interest, the officers, directors and other members of management of this Corporation shall be free to engage in such areas of interest on their own and this doctrine shall not limit the rights of any officer, director or other member of management of this Corporation to continue a business existing prior to the time that such area of interest is designated by the Corporation. This provision shall not be construed to release any employee of this Corporation (other than an officer, director or member of management) from any duties which he may have to this Corporation.\\n\\nARTICLE VII\\n\\nINDEMNIFICATION\\n\\n1\\\\. The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\\\. The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation; but no identification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses which such court deems proper.\\n\\n3\\\\. To the extent that a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in this article or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he may be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.\\n\\n4\\\\. Any indemnification under paragraph 1 or 2 of this article (unless ordered by a court) may be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said paragraphs 1 or 2. Such determination shall be made by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or, if such a quorum is not obtainable or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or by the shareholders.\\n\\n5\\\\. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding as authorized in paragraph 4 of this article upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent to repay such amount unless it is ultimately determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this article.\\n\\n6\\\\. The indemnification provided by this article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under the Articles of Incorporation, any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, and any procedure provided for by any of the foregoing, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent and shall inure to the benefit of heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.\\n\\n7\\\\. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Corporation or who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this article.\\n\\n8\\\\. A unanimous vote of each class of shares entitled to vote shall be required to amend this article.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nARTICLE VIII\\n\\nAMENDMENTS\\n\\nThe Corporation reserves the right to amend its Articles of Incorporation from time to time in accordance with the Colorado Business Corporation Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Article IV of these Articles of Incorporation cannot be amended in any way without the consent of a majority of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. Furthermore, the previous sentence of this Article VIII cannot be amended in any way without the consent of a majority of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.\\n\\nARTICLE IX\\n\\nADOPTION AND AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS\\n\\nThe initial Bylaws of the Corporation shall be adopted by its board of directors. Subject to repeal or change by action of the shareholders, the power to alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws or adopt new Bylaws shall be vested in the board of directors. The Bylaws may contain any provisions for the regulation and management of the affairs of the Corporation not inconsistent with law or these Articles of Incorporation.\\n\\nARTICLE X\\n\\nSHAREHOLDER ACTIONS WITHOUT A MEETING\\n\\nAny action required or otherwise permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting if the shareholders holding not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all of the shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted consent to such action in writing.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n/s/ Mark D.

If the Corporation does not issue fractions of a share, it shall (1) arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by those entitled thereto, (2) pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, or (3) issue scrip or warrants in registered form (either represented by a certificate or uncertificated) or bearer form (represented by a certificate) which shall entitle the holder to receive a full share upon the surrender of such scrip or warrants aggregating a full share. A certificate for a fractional share or an uncertificated fractional share shall, but scrip or warrants shall not unless otherwise provided therein, entitle the holder to exercise voting rights, to receive dividends thereon, and to participate in any of the assets of the Corporation in the event of liquidation. The Board of Directors may cause scrip or warrants to be issued subject to the conditions that they shall become void if not exchanged for certificates representing the full shares or uncertificated full shares before a specified date, or subject to the conditions that the shares for which scrip or warrants are exchangeable may be sold by the corporation and the proceeds thereof distributed to the holders of scrip or warrants, or subject to any other conditions which the Board of Directors may impose.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSection 4.

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Notice need not be given to any stockholder who submits a written waiver of notice signed by him before or after the time stated therein. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, not the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice.\\n\\n(e) Stockholder List.

Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or by his attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that is irrevocable and, if, and only as long as it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n(h) Inspectors. The directors, in advance of any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.

All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the shareholders or the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth in the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation. \\n\\n(4) The Corporation shall abide by the following restrictions: \\n\\n(a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock as provided for in Section 1 are in arrears or the Corporation shall be in default in payment thereof, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid or set aside for payment in full, and in addition to any and all other rights which any holder of shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock may have in such circumstances, the Corporation shall not: \\n\\n1\\\\. declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock; \\n\\n3 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\\\. declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, unless dividends are paid ratably on the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; \\n\\n3\\\\. redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock; or \\n\\n4\\\\. redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes. \\n\\n(b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. \\n\\n(5) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have the following rights: \\n\\n(a) No distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have received $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that following such payment the holders of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be further entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the \\n\\n4 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\naggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. \\n\\n(b) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the above-described liquidation preference of the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of all such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. \\n\\n(c) In the event the Corporation shall at any time, after the Declaration Date, declare or pay a dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of paragraph (a) of this Section 5 shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. \\n\\n(6) In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or converted into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or converted in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is converted or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or conversion of shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. \\n\\n(7) The shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable. \\n\\n5 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n(8) The Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all shares or series of shares of any other class of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock. \\n\\n(9) The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class. \\n\\n(10) Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder’s fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock. \\n\\nARTICLE IV \\n\\nDIRECTORS \\n\\nA. Number of Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of such number of persons as shall be designated from time to time in the by-laws of the Corporation, or, if not so designated, as may be designated from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that no decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. \\n\\nB. Classification. The Board of Directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock having preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation (whose terms of office may be determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article III(B)), shall be divided, with respect to the time during which, they shall bold office, into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible, with the initial term of office of the Class I directors expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 1998, of the Class II directors expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders, and of the Class III directors expiring at the second succeeding annual meeting, with all such directors to hold office until their successors are elected and qualified. At each subsequent annual meeting of shareholders, directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. If the Board of Directors shall appoint any director to fill a vacancy on the Board, whether resulting from an increase in the number of directors or otherwise, such Director shall be assigned to a class by the Board of Directors so that all classes of directors shall be as nearly equal in number as possible. In the event of a decrease in the number of directors, the Board of Directors may reassign the remaining directors to classes so that all classes of directors shall be as nearly equal in number as possible. \\n\\nC. Vacancies. Except as provided in Article IV(F) hereof, any vacancy on the Board (including any vacancy resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or from a failure of the shareholders to elect the full number of authorized directors) may, notwithstanding any resulting absence of a quorum of directors, be filled by a vote of at least \\n\\n6 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\ntwo-thirds of the directors remaining in office, provided that the shareholders shall have the right to fill the vacancy at any special meeting called for such purpose prior to any such action by the Board. Vacancies on the Board may be filled only as provided in this Article IV(C). \\n\\nD. Removal. Except as provided in Article IV(F) hereof, any one or more directors may be removed, at any time, (i) with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then constituting the Board of Directors or (ii) only for cause, by the holders of not less than two-thirds of the Total Voting Power (as defined in Article VII(C) hereof) that is present or represented at a special meeting of shareholders called for such purpose, voting together as a single class. For purposes of this Article IV(D), “cause” shall mean (i) a conviction of a director by a court of competent jurisdiction of a felony involving moral turpitude if such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal or (ii) an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of liability for gross negligence or gross misconduct in the performance of the director’s duty to the Corporation in a matter of substantial importance to the Corporation if such adjudication is no longer subject to direct appeal. At the same meeting in which the directors or shareholders remove one or more directors, a successor or successors may be elected for the unexpired term of the director or directors removed. Except as set forth in this Article IV(D), or in any provision of these Articles of Incorporation relating to removal of directors elected by holders of Preferred Stock, directors shall not be subject to removal. \\n\\nE. Board Nominations. Except as provided in Article IV(F) hereof, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article IV(E) shall be eligible for election as directors.

Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder’s notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation not less than 45 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting, provided, however, that in the event that less than 55 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such shareholder’s notice shall set forth or include the following: \\n\\n1\\\\. as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, (a) the name, age, business address and residential address of such person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (c) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation of which such person is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange “Act”)), (d) such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected and (e) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of directors, or would be otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act; and \\n\\n7 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\\\. as to the shareholder of record giving the notice, (a) the name and address of such shareholder and (b) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation of which such shareholder is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act). If requested in writing by the Secretary of the Corporation at least 15 days in advance of the meeting, such shareholder shall disclose to the Secretary, within ten days of such request, whether such person is the sole beneficial owner of the shares held of record by him, and, if not, the name and address of each other person known by the shareholder of record to claim or have a beneficial interest in such shares. \\n\\nAt the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in a shareholders notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. If a shareholder seeks to nominate one or more directors, the Secretary shall appoint two inspectors, who shall not be affiliated with the Corporation, to determine whether the shareholder has complied with this Article IV(E). If the inspectors shall determine that the shareholder has not complied with this Article IV(E), the defective nomination shall be disregarded and the inspectors shall direct the Chairman of the meeting to declare at the meeting that such nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Articles of Incorporation. \\n\\nF. Directors Elected by Preferred Shareholders. Notwithstanding anything in these Articles of Incorporation to the contrary, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation (as they may be duly amended from time to time) fixing the rights and preferences of such preferred stock shall govern with respect to the nomination, election, term, removal, vacancies or other related matters with respect to such directors. \\n\\nARTICLE V \\n\\nBY-LAWS \\n\\nA. Adoption, Amendment and Repeal. By-laws of the Corporation may be adopted only by a majority vote of the Board of Directors. By-laws may be amended or repealed only by (i) a two-thirds vote of all directors who constitute the Board of Directors, or (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent of that portion of the Total Voting Power, as defined in Article VII(C) hereof, voting together as a single class, that is present or represented at any regular or special meeting of shareholders, the notice of which meeting of shareholders expressly states that the proposed amendment or repeal is to be considered at the meeting. \\n\\nB. New Matters. Any purported amendment to the By-laws which would add thereto a matter not expressly covered in the By-laws prior to such purported amendment shall be deemed to constitute the adoption of a By-law provision and not an amendment to the By-laws. \\n\\n8 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nARTICLE VI \\n\\nAPPLICATION OF CERTAIN LAWS \\n\\nThe Corporation hereby elects not to be governed by Sections 132, 133 and 134 of the Louisiana Business Corporation Law (La.R.S. 12:132, La.R.S. 12:133 and La.R.S. 12:134). \\n\\nARTICLE VII \\n\\nSPECIAL SHAREHOLDER VOTING REQUIREMENTS \\n\\nA. Amendments. Unless approved by vote of at least two-thirds of the directors constituting the Board of Directors, Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and X of the Articles of Incorporation may be amended only by the affirmative vote of not less than eighty percent of the Total Voting Power of the Corporation. \\n\\nB. Other Corporate Actions. If a vote of shareholders is required to authorize an agreement of merger or consolidation of the Corporation, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or the voluntary dissolution of the Corporation, then, unless such action has been approved by vote of at least two-thirds of the directors constituting the Board of Directors, such action may be authorized only by the affirmative vote of eighty percent of the Total Voting Power of the Corporation. \\n\\nC. Total Voting Power. The term “Total Voting Power” means the total number of votes that shareholders, and holders of any bonds, debentures or other obligations granted voting rights by the Corporation pursuant to La.R.S. 12:75(H), are generally entitled to cast with respect to the election of directors or, if such term is used with reference to any other particular matter properly brought before the shareholders or such other holders for their consideration and vote, means the total number of such votes that are entitled to be cast with respect to such matter. \\n\\nARTICLE VIII \\n\\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION \\n\\nA. Limitation of Liability. No director or officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or to its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of his fiduciary duty as a director or officer, provided that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer for (1) any breach of his duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders; (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3) liability for unlawful distributions of the Corporation’s assets to, or redemptions or repurchases of the Corporation’s shares from shareholders of the Corporation, under and to the extent provided in La.R.S. 12:92(D); or (4) any transaction from which he derived an improper personal benefit. If, after the date hereof, the Louisiana Business Corporation Law is amended to authorize further elimination or limitation the personal liability of directors or officers, then the liability of a director or an officer of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Louisiana Business Corporation Law, as so amended. \\n\\nB. Indemnification. Subject to such limitations as may be determined by the Board of Directors (provided that no change in such limitations may adversely affect any claim to indemnification that arises prior to such change), the Corporation shall indemnify each of its \\n\\n9 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\ndirectors to the full extent from time to time permitted by law, and may so indemnify each of its officers, against any expenses or costs, including attorney’s fees, actually or reasonably incurred by him in connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative against such person or as to which he is involved solely as a witness or person required to give evidence. \\n\\nC. Authorization of Further Actions. The Board of Directors may (1) cause the Corporation to enter into contracts with its directors and officers providing for the limitation of liability set forth in this Article to the fullest extent permitted by law, (2) adopt By-laws or resolutions, or cause the Corporation to enter into contracts, providing for indemnification of directors and officers of the Corporation and other persons (including but not limited to directors and officers of the Corporation’s direct and indirect subsidiaries) to the fullest extent permitted by law and (3) cause the Corporation to exercise the powers set forth in La.R.S. 12:83F, notwithstanding that some or all of the members of the Board of Directors acting with respect to the foregoing may be parties to such contracts or beneficiaries of such By-laws or resolutions or the exercise of such powers. No repeal or amendment of any such By-laws or resolutions limiting the right to indemnification thereunder shall affect the entitlement of any person to indemnification whose claim thereto results from conduct occurring prior to the date of such repeal or amendment. \\n\\nD. Subsidiaries. The Board of Directors may cause the Corporation to approve for its direct and indirect subsidiaries limitation of liability and indemnification provisions comparable to the foregoing. \\n\\nE. Amendment. In addition to any other votes required by law or these Articles of Incorporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law or these Articles of Incorporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the Total Voting Power shall be required to repeal this Article or to amend this Article so as to reduce the limitation of liability set forth herein or the rights to indemnification or the powers of the Board of Directors provided in this Article, and any amendment or repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect any indemnification or limitation of liability of a director or officer of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any action or inaction occurring prior to the time of such amendment or repeal. \\n\\nARTICLE IX \\n\\nREVERSION \\n\\nCash, property or share dividends, shares issuable to shareholders in connection with a reclassification of stock, and the redemption price of redeemed shares, that are not claimed by the shareholders entitled thereto within one year after the dividend or redemption price became payable or the shares became issuable, despite reasonable efforts by the Corporation to pay the dividend or redemption price or deliver the certificates for the shares to such shareholders within such time, shall at the expiration of such time, revert in full ownership to the Corporation, and the Corporation’s obligation to pay such dividend or redemption price or issue such shares, as the case may be, shall thereupon cease, provided, however, that the Board of Directors may, at any time, for any reason satisfactory to it, but need not, authorize (1) payment of the amount of any cash or property dividend or redemption price or (2) issuance of any shares, ownership of which has reverted to the Corporation pursuant to this Article, to the person or entity who or which would be entitled thereto had such reversion not occurred. \\n\\n10 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nARTICLE X \\n\\nSPECIAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS \\n\\nA. Special meetings of shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called in any manner set forth in the By-laws, provided that the power of shareholders as such to call or cause to be called special meetings shall be governed exclusively by paragraph B of this Article. \\n\\nB. At any time, upon the written request of any shareholder or group of shareholders holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the Total Voting Power, the Secretary of the Corporation shall call a special meeting of shareholders to be held at the registered office of the Corporation at such time as the Secretary may fix not less than 15 nor more than 60 days after the receipt of said request, and if the Secretary shall neglect or refuse to fix such time or to give notice of the meeting, the shareholder or shareholders making the request may do so.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.\\n\\n(b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the District Court or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the District Court or such other court shall deem proper.\\n\\n(c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.\\n\\n(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n-3-\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n(e) Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 3.\\n\\n(f) The indemnification provided by this Section 3 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.\\n\\n(g) The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section.\\n\\nSection 4.

As to any matter disposed of by a compromise payment by such director or officer, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise, no indemnification either for said payment or for any other expenses shall be provided unless such compromise shall be approved as in the best interests of the corporation, after notice that it involves such indemnification, (a) by a disinterested majority of the directors then in office, (b) by a majority of the disinterested directors then in office, provided that there has been obtained an opinion in writing of independent legal counsel to the effect that such director or officer appears to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his action was in the best interests of the corporation, or (c) by the vote, at a meeting duly called and held, of the holders of a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, exclusive of any shares owned by any interested director or officer.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIn discharging his duties any director or officer, when acting in good faith, shall be fully entitled to rely upon such information, opinions, reports or records, including financial statements, books of account and other financial records, in each case presented or prepared by, or under the supervision of, (a) one or more officers or employees of the corporation (or of another organization in which he serves as contemplated by this Article IX) whom the director or officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, (b) counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters which the director or officer reasonably believes to be within such person\\'s professional or expert competence, or (c) in the case of a director, a duly constituted committee of the board of directors (or similar governing body of such other organization) upon which he does not serve as to matters within its delegated authority, which committee the director reasonably believes to merit confidence, but he shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if he has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted. The fact that a director or officer so relied shall be a complete defense to any claim asserted against him, except as expressly provided by statute, by reason of his being or having been a director or officer of the corporation (or such other organization).\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nNo director or officer shall be liable for any act, omission, step or conduct taken or had in good faith, which (whether by condition or otherwise) is required, authorized or approved by any order or orders issued pursuant to any Federal, state or municipal statute, regulation or other lawful authority regulating the company by reason of its being a public utility company or being affiliated with public utility holding companies or by reason of its or their activities as such, or any amendments to any thereof. In any action, suit or proceeding based on any act, omission, step or conduct, as in this paragraph described, the provisions hereof shall be brought to the attention of the court or regulatory body. In the event that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph are found by the court or regulatory body not to constitute a valid defense on the grounds of not being applicable to the particular class of plaintiff, each such director or officer shall be reimbursed for, or indemnified against, all loss, liability and expense incurred by him or imposed on him, in connection with, or arising out of, any such action, suit or proceeding based on any act, omission, step or conduct taken or had in good faith as in this paragraph described; provided, however, that as to any matter disposed of by a compromise payment by such director or officer, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise, no indemnification either for said payment or for any other expenses shall be provided unless such compromise shall be provided as in the best interest of the corporation as heretofore provided in this Article IX. Such loss, liability and expense shall include, but shall not be limited to, judgments, court costs and attorneys\\' fees.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nExpenses incurred with respect to the defense or disposition of any action, suit or proceeding heretofore referred to in this Article IX shall be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the recipient to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to indemnification, which undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the recipient to make such repayment.

Right to Indemnification.\\n\\n(i) Persons Entitled to Indemnification. Subject to applicable Delaware law as existing or hereafter amended, the Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation (“Indemnitee”). Further, this indemnification right will extend to each person who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans.\\n\\n(ii) Scope of Indemnification. The indemnification right will extend to persons entitled to such right whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or inaction in an official capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent.\\n\\n(iii) Expenses Indemnified. The Corporation will indemnify persons entitled to indemnity against all costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n(iv) Survival. The indemnification right outlined in this paragraph 7.01, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, will continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent. Further, the indemnification right will inure to the benefit of such Indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators.\\n\\n(v) Limitation of Indemnification. The Corporation will indemnify any Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.\\n\\nSection 7.02. Repayment of Indemnified Expenses. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (“Advance Payment”). Nevertheless, if Delaware law so requires, such Advance Payment of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) will be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this paragraph, under Delaware law, or otherwise.\\n\\nSection 7.03. Indemnification of Other Persons. The Corporation may, by action of the Board, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the indemnification of directors and officers as outlined in paragraphs 7.01 and 7.02 above.\\n\\nSection 7.04. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim brought under paragraph 7.01, 7.02, or 7.03 of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If the claimant’s suit is successful in whole or in part, the claimant will be entitled to recover also the expense of prosecuting such claim.\\n\\n(i) Valid Defenses to the Claimant’s Action. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Advance Payment where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has failed to meet a standard of conduct which makes it permissible under Delaware law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.\\n\\n(ii) Invalid Defenses to the Claimant’s Action. Neither of the following acts or omissions will be a defense to the claimant’s action or create a presumption that the claimant has failed to meet the standard of conduct described in paragraph 7.04(i) above:\\n\\n(a) the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is permissible in the circumstances because the claimant has met such standard of conduct; or\\n\\n(b) an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such standard of conduct.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSection 7.05. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and to Advance Payments conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any: (i) statute; (ii) provision of the Certificate of Incorporation; (iii) bylaw; (iv) agreement; (v) vote of stockholders; (vi) vote of disinterested directors; or (vii) otherwise.\\n\\nSection 7.06. Insurance. Regardless of whether the Corporation would have the power under Delaware law to indemnify itself or any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, the Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect such persons or entities against any such expense, liability or loss.\\n\\nSection 7.07. Certain Provisions Related to Employee Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Article, references to “other enterprises” shall include employee benefit plans; references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to “serving at the request of the Corporation” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries.\\n\\nSection 7.08. Expenses as a Witness. The Corporation will indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation who, by reason of such position, or a position with another entity at the request of the Corporation, is a witness in any Proceeding. Such indemnity will cover all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the witness or on his or her behalf in connection with the Proceeding.\\n\\nSection 7.09. Indemnity Agreements. The Corporation may enter into agreements with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation providing for indemnification to the full extent permitted by Delaware law.\\n\\nARTICLE EIGHT\\n\\nCAPITAL STOCK\\n\\nSection 8.01.

Checks, Notes, Drafts, Etc. Checks, notes, drafts, acceptances, bills of exchange and other orders or obligations for the payment of money shall be signed by such officer or officers or person or persons as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof may from time to time designate.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nARTICLE TEN\\n\\nOFFICES\\n\\nSection 10.01.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to any action or proceeding (formal or informal), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether by or in the right of the Company or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person, such person\\'s testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, or served any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity at the request of the Company, against all loss and expense including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, judgments, fines (including excise taxes), amounts paid in settlement and attorneys\\' fees and disbursements actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, or any appeal therefrom, and all legal fees and expenses incurred in successfully asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 15; provided, however, that no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of any director, officer or employee if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the director, officer or employee estab\\xadlishes that such person\\'s acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that such person personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which such person was not legally entitled.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIn any case in which a director, officer or employee of the Company (or a representative of the estate of such director, officer or employee) requests indemnification, upon such person\\'s request the Board of Directors shall meet within sixty days thereof to determine whether such person is eligible for indemni\\xadfication in accordance with the standard set forth above. Such a person claiming indemnification shall be entitled to indemnifica\\xadtion upon a determination that no judgment or other final adjudi\\xadcation adverse to such person has established that such person\\'s acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that such person personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which such person was not legally entitled. Such determination shall be made:\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n(a) by the Board of Directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought; or  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n\\n(b) if such quorum is unobtainable or if directed by such quorum, then by either (i) the Board of Directors upon the opinion in writing of independent legal counsel that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because such person is eligible for indemnification in accordance with the standard set forth above, or (ii) by the stockholders upon a finding that such person is eligible for indemnifica\\xadtion in accordance with the standard set forth above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a determination of eligibil\\xadity for indemnification may be made in any manner permitted by law.  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n\\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall promptly advance to any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to any action or proceeding (formal or informal), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether by or in the right of the Company or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person, such person\\'s testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, or served any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity at the request of the Company, expenses incurred in defending such actions or proceedings, upon request of such person and receipt of an undertaking by or on \\n\\n5\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nbehalf of such director, officer or employee to repay amounts advanced to the extent that it is ultimately determined that such person was not eligible for indemnification in accordance with the standard set forth above.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nThe foregoing provisions of this Section 15 shall be deemed to be a contract between the Company and each director, officer or employee of the Company, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, and any modification or repeal of this Section 15 or such provi\\xadsions of the New York Business Corporation Law shall not diminish any rights or obligations existing prior to such modification or repeal with respect to any action or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought; provided, however, that the right of indemni\\xadfication provided in this Section 15 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any director, officer or employee of the Company may now be or hereafter become entitled apart from this Section 15, under any applicable law including the New York Business Corporation Law. Irrespective of the provisions of this Section 15, the Board of Directors may, at any time or from time to time, approve indemnification of directors, officers, employees or agents to the full extent permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law at the time in effect, whether on account of past or future actions or transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall enter into such additional contracts providing for indemnification and advancement of expenses with directors, officers or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates as the Board of Directors shall authorize, provided that the terms of any such contract shall be consistent with the provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nAs used in this Section 15, the term \"employee\" shall include, without limitation, any employee, including any profes\\xadsionally licensed employee, of the Company. Such term shall also include, without limitation, any employee, including any profes\\xadsionally licensed employee, of a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company who is acting on behalf of the Company.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nThe indemnification provided by this Section 15 shall be limited with respect to directors, officers and controlling persons to the extent provided in any undertaking entered into by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission now or hereafter in effect.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIf any action with respect to indemnification of directors or officers is taken by way of amendment to these By-Laws, resolution of the Board of Directors, or by agreement, then the Company shall give such notice to the stockholders as is required by law.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nThe Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person described in this Section 15 against any liability which may be asserted against such person whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Section 15 or other\\xadwise.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIf any provision of this Section 15 shall be found to be invalid or limited in application by reason of any law, regula\\xadtion or proceeding, it shall not affect any other provision or the validity of the remaining provisions hereof.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nThe provisions of this Section 15 shall be applicable to claims, actions, suits or proceedings made, commenced or pending after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or after the adoption hereof. (As amended October 29, 1986.)  \\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSection 16. These By-Laws may be amended or added to at any meeting of the Board of Directors by affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors, if notice of the proposed change has been delivered or mailed to the directors five days before the meeting, or if all the directors are present, or if all not present assent in writing to such change; provided, however, that the provisions of Section 7 relating to the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors may be amended only by the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company; and provided further that the provisions of Section 7 other than those relating to the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors, and the provisions of this Section 16 may be amended or added to only by the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company; and provided further, in the event of any such amendment or addition pursuant to vote by the stock\\xadholders of the Company, that such amendment or addition, or a summary thereof, shall have been set forth or referred to in the notice of such meeting. (As renumbered and amended October 29, 1986.)\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSection 17. Each holder of common stock shall have one vote for every share of common stock entitled to vote which is registered in his or her name on the record date for the meeting. In cases where the number of nominees is less than or equal to the number of directors to be elected, each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this Section 17, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast “for” a director’s election exceeds 50% of the total number of votes cast with respect to that director’s election. Votes cast shall include votes “for,” “against” or to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director’s election. In cases where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIf a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected at a meeting of stockholders and no successor has been elected at the meeting, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors promptly after the certification of the election results by the inspector of elections. The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether or not to accept the tendered resignation. The Board of Directors shall make the decision whether or not to accept the tendered resignation, taking into account the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance’s recommendation. The Board’s decision about the tendered resignation, and the rationale behind the decision, shall be disclosed in a public announcement within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results by the inspector of elections. The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making the decision, may consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance or the decision of the Board of Directors about his or her resignation. If the incumbent director’s resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director’s resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this By-Law, or if a nominee for director is not \\n\\n7\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nelected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.

The annual meeting of the shareholders of CNB Bancorp, Inc, (the Corporation) for the election of Directors and transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting, shall be held each year on such business day as shall be designated in a resolution of the Board of Directors. The failure to hold an annual meeting at the time stated in or fixed in accordance with these Bylaws does not affect the validity of any action taken by the Corporation \\n\\n1.3 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors on its own motion or on the motion of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or such other person or persons authorized to do so by law, and upon such call the Board of Directors shall fix the date of such special meeting.

Any number of shareholders together holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote with respect to the business to be transacted, who shall be present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting duly called, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If less than a quorum shall be in attendance at the time for which a meeting shall have been called, the meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the shareholders present or represented by proxy without notice other than by announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall attend. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting of shareholders, it shall be deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is, or shall be, set for that adjourned meeting. A majority of the votes cast shall decide every question or matter submitted to the shareholders at any meeting, unless otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Association, or Articles of Incorporation. \\n\\n1.6 Voting.

An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from its date, unless otherwise expressly provided in the proxy. If a quorum is present at a meeting of the shareholders, action on a matter other than election of Directors shall be approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the action, unless a vote of a greater number is required by the Articles of Incorporation or by law. If a quorum is present at a meeting of the shareholders, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in such election. \\n\\n1.7 Inspectors. An appropriate number of inspectors for any meeting of shareholders may be appointed by the Chairman of such meeting.

The Board of Directors shall hold periodic meetings, at which meeting a majority of the whole Board shall be necessary for the lawful transaction of business. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at places within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia and at times fixed by the Board, or upon call of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or President, or at the request of three (3) of the Directors.

Meetings may be held at any time without notice if all of the Directors are present, or if those not present waive notice in writing either before or after the meeting. The notice of meetings of the Board need not state the purpose of the meeting. Members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated thereby may participate in a meeting of the Board or such committee by any means of communication whereby all persons participating in the meeting can simultaneously hear each other, and participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. A written record shall be made of any action taken at a meeting conducted by such means of communication. \\n\\n6 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe Corporation’s Board of Directors will meet as needed, and on call of the Chairman or other authorized Officer. \\n\\n2.4 Quorum.

Such action shall be effective when the last Director or committee member, as the case may be, signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date, in which event an action so taken shall be effective on the date specified therein. A signed consent has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. \\n\\n2.6 Compensation. By resolution of the Board of Directors, Directors may be allowed a fee and expenses for attendance at all meetings, as well as discount and other privileges. Nothing herein shall preclude Directors from serving the Corporation in other capacities and receiving compensation for such other services. \\n\\n2.7 Retirement Age of Directors; Directors Emeritus.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. \\n\\n(2) For purposes of this By-Law, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and shares of stock shall be treated as “beneficially owned” by a person if the person beneficially owns such shares, directly or indirectly, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulations 13D and 13G thereunder or has or shares pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing): (a) the right to acquire such shares (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time or the fulfillment of a condition or both), (b) the right to vote such shares, alone or in concert with others and/or (c) investment power with respect to such shares, including the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, such shares. \\n\\n(3) For purposes of this By-Law, no postponement of any meeting to a date not more than 60 days after the record date and no adjournment nor notice of adjournment of any meeting shall be deemed to constitute a new notice of such meeting for purposes of this Section 11, and in order for any notification required to be delivered by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 11 to be timely, such notification must be delivered within the periods set forth above with respect to the originally scheduled meeting. \\n\\n6 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law. Nothing in this By-Law shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. \\n\\nARTICLE II. \\n\\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS \\n\\nSection 1. The Board of Directors of the corporation shall consist of such number of directors, not less than three, as shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by resolution of the Board of Directors. Each director’s term shall be as set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation. Each director subject to election at a meeting shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at such meeting assuming that a quorum is present, provided that if as of a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date the corporation files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote. A majority of the total number of directors then in office (but not less than one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and, except as otherwise provided by law or by the corporation’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders. \\n\\nFor purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that director. Any director subject to election at a meeting who fails to receive, to the extent required, a majority of the votes cast, shall tender his resignation for consideration by the Board of Directors in accordance with the corporation’s Director Resignation Policy, as it may be in effect from time to time. \\n\\nSection 2. Newly created directorships in the Board of Directors that result from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and the directors so chosen shall hold office for a term as set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation. If any applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent in voting power of all shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting as a single class. \\n\\n7 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSection 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the notice of any meeting. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, by oral, or written notice including, telegraph, telex or transmission of a telecopy, e-mail or other means of transmission, duly served on or sent or mailed to each director to such director’s address or telecopy number as shown on the books of the corporation not less than one day before the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders at the same place at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting in person (except when the director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing. \\n\\nSection 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately by series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation expressly applicable to such directorships. The number of directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock shall be in addition to the number fixed by or pursuant to the By-Laws. \\n\\nSection 5. If at any meeting for the election of directors, the corporation has outstanding more than one class of stock, and one or more such classes or series thereof are entitled to vote separately as a class, and there shall be a quorum of only one such class or series of stock, that class or series of stock shall be entitled to elect its quota of directors notwithstanding absence of a quorum of the other class or series of stock. \\n\\nSection 6. The Board of Directors may designate three or more directors to constitute an executive committee, one of whom shall be designated Chairman of such committee. The members of such committee shall hold such office until their successors are elected and qualify. Any vacancy occurring in the committee shall be filled by the Board of Directors. Regular meetings of the committee shall be held at such times and on such notice and at such places as it may from time to time determine. The committee shall act, advise with and aid the officers of the corporation in all matters concerning its interest and the management of its business, and shall generally perform such duties and exercise such powers as may from time to time be delegated to it by the Board of Directors, and shall have authority to exercise all the powers of the Board of Directors, so far as may be permitted by law, in the management of the business and the affairs of the corporation whenever the Board of Directors is not in session or whenever a quorum of the \\n\\n8 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBoard of Directors fails to attend any regular or special meeting of such Board. The committee shall have power to authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which are required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to have the seal affixed thereto. The fact that the executive committee has acted shall be conclusive evidence that the Board of Directors was not in session at such time or that a quorum of the Board had failed to attend the regular or special meeting thereof. \\n\\nThe executive committee shall keep regular minutes of its transactions and shall cause them to be recorded in a book kept in the office of the corporation designated for that purpose, and shall report the same to the Board of Directors at their regular meeting. The committee shall make and adopt its own rules for the government thereof and shall elect its own officers. \\n\\nSection 7. The Board of Directors may from time to time establish such other committees to serve at the pleasure of the Board which shall be comprised of such members of the Board and have such duties as the Board shall from time to time establish. Any director may belong to any number of committees of the Board. The Board may also establish such other committees with such members (whether or not directors) and such duties as the Board may from time to time determine. \\n\\nSection 8. Unless otherwise restricted by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors. \\n\\nSection 9. The members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute presence in person at such a meeting. \\n\\nSection 10. The Board of Directors may establish policies for the compensation of directors and for the reimbursement of the expenses of directors, in each case, in connection with services provided by directors to the corporation. \\n\\nSection 11. The Board of Directors shall elect one of its members to be Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board shall preside at meetings of the Board of Directors at which he is present and shall have the powers and duties prescribed by law, by the By-Laws and by the Board of Directors. \\n\\n9 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nARTICLE III. \\n\\nOFFICERS \\n\\nSection 1. The Board of Directors, promptly after each annual meeting of the stockholders, shall elect officers of the corporation, including a Chief Executive Officer and a Secretary. The Chief Executive Officer shall have the general direction of the affairs of the corporation. The Board of Directors may also from time to time elect such other officers (including a President, who may but need not be a different person than the Chief Executive Officer, one or more Vice Presidents, a Treasurer, one or more Assistant Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries and one or more Assistant Treasurers) as it may deem proper or may delegate to any elected officer of the corporation the power to appoint and remove any such other officers and to prescribe their respective terms of office, authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated Executive, Senior or Corporate, or may be given such other designation or combination of designations as the Board of Directors may determine. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person. \\n\\nSection 2. All officers of the corporation elected by the Board of Directors shall hold office for such term as may be determined by the Board of Directors or until their respective successors are chosen and qualified. Any officer may be removed from office at any time either with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, or, in the case of appointed officers, by any elected officer upon whom such power of removal shall have been conferred by the Board of Directors. \\n\\nSection 3. Each of the officers of the corporation elected by the Board of Directors or appointed by an officer in accordance with these By-laws shall have the powers and duties prescribed by law, by the By-Laws and by the Board of Directors and, in the case of appointed officers, the powers and duties prescribed by the appointing officer, and, unless otherwise prescribed by the By-Laws or by the Board of Directors or such appointing officer, shall have such further powers and duties as ordinarily pertain to that office. \\n\\nSection 4. Unless otherwise provided in these By-Laws, in the absence or disability of any officer of the corporation, the Board of Directors may, during such period, delegate such officer’s powers and duties to any other officer or to any director and the person to whom such powers and duties are delegated shall, for the time being, hold such office. \\n\\nARTICLE IV. \\n\\nCERTIFICATES OF STOCK \\n\\nSection 1. The shares of stock of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the corporation’s stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board \\n\\n10 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nof Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, or as otherwise permitted by law, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.

No certificate for shares of stock in the corporation shall be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, except upon production of such evidence of such loss, theft or destruction and upon delivery to the corporation of a bond of indemnity in such amount, upon such terms and secured by such surety, as the Board of Directors in its discretion may require. \\n\\nARTICLE V. \\n\\nCORPORATE BOOKS \\n\\nThe books of the corporation may be kept outside of the State of Delaware at such place or places as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. \\n\\nARTICLE VI. \\n\\nCHECKS, NOTES, PROXIES, ETC. \\n\\nAll checks and drafts on the corporation’s bank accounts and all bills of exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances, obligations and other instruments for the payment of money, shall be signed by such officer or officers or agent or agents as shall be hereunto authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Upon the date this Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation becomes effective, the article Fourth of the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation is amended in its entirety to read as follows:   \\n  \\n“FOURTH:\\n\\nThe corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock, to be designated, respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock”. The total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is 95,000,000 shares. 70,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock.  \\n  \\nThe Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to fix or alter the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, and the liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.  \\n  \\nEach one share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the time this amendment becomes effective shall be and is hereby automatically combined, reclassified and changed (by way of reverse stock split, without any further act) into one-two thousandth (1/2,000th) of a share of Common Stock; provided that no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued in respect of any shares of Common Stock held by any holder in a discrete account, whether of record or with a nominee, and that instead of issuing such fractional shares of Common Stock, the corporation shall pay in cash, as of the time this amendment becomes effective, at the rate of $260.00 per one post-reverse split share (i.e., $0.13 for each pre-reverse split share which is traceable to a fractional post-reverse split share).”  \\n  \\n3. The foregoing amendment of the Articles of Incorporation has been duly approved by the Board of Directors.   \\n  \\n4. The foregoing amendment of the Articles of Incorporation has been duly approved by the required vote of shareholders in accordance with Sections 902 and 903 of the California Corporations Code.

No shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are outstanding. The number of shares voting in favor of the amendment equaled or exceeded the vote required. The percentage vote required was more than 50 percent of all outstanding shares (i.e., more than 50 percent of all votes entitled to be cast), more than 50 percent of all outstanding shares of Common Stock, and more than 50 percent of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock.   \\n  \\n-1- \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n5.

An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the corporation’s transfer agent or other person designated by the corporation to give notice on behalf of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.\\n\\n(d) For purposes of these By-Laws, “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.\\n\\nSection 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation; but if at any regularly called meeting of stockholders there be less than a quorum present, the stockholders present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.\\n\\nSection 5. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the Chairman’s absence or at the Chairman’s direction, the President, or in the President’s absence or at the President’s direction, any officer of the corporation shall call all meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of such meeting. The Secretary or, in the Secretary’s absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting. If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of the corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting, whether any stockholder or stockholders’ proxy may be excluded from any meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the chairman, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is\\n\\n2\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nlikely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders. The chairman of the meeting shall have authority to adjourn any meeting of stockholders.\\n\\nSection 6. At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be acted upon after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: (a) a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and execution of the writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder’s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or (b) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspector of elections shall specify the information upon which they relied.\\n\\nAny copy, facsimile telecommunication, electronic transmission or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 6 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication, electronic transmission or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.\\n\\nProxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the commencement of the meeting to which they relate.\\n\\nSection 7. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.\\n\\n3\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSection 8. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders (a) entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or (b) entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date (i) in the case of clause (a) above, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, and (ii) in the case of clause (b) above, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such action. If for any reason the Board of Directors shall not have fixed a record date for any such purpose, the record date for such purpose shall be determined as provided by law. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed or determined shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights, notwithstanding the transfer of any stock owned by such stockholders on the books of the corporation after any such record date so fixed or determined.\\n\\nSection 9. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the corporation or at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced at the time and kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.\\n\\nSection 10. The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting of the stockholders, shall appoint one or more inspectors of elections to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. Any inspector of elections may be a stockholder or its proxy, but may not be a director of the corporation or candidate for office of the corporation. In the event that the Board of Directors fails to so appoint one or more inspectors of elections or, in the event that one or more inspectors of elections previously designated by the Board of Directors fails to appear or act at the meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors of elections to fill such vacancy or vacancies. Each inspector of elections appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector of elections with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector’s ability. The inspectors of elections shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each; (b) determine the shares represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; (c) count all votes and ballots; (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspector of elections; (e)\\n\\n4\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\ncertify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots; and (f) take any other actions as may be required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\\n\\nSection 11. (a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders. (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (A) pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting delivered pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of these By-Laws, (B) by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or (C) by any stockholder of the corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who complied with the notice procedures set forth in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (a) of this By-Law and who was a stockholder of record at the time such notice is delivered to the Secretary.\\n\\n(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(1) of this By-Law, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary, and, in the case of business other than nominations, such other business must be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than seventy days nor more than ninety days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than twenty days, or delayed by more than seventy days, from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the seventieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder’s notice shall set forth (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation’s books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.\\n\\n(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of this By-Law to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to\\n\\n5\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nthe Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the corporation at least eighty days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice required by this By-Law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.\\n\\n(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting pursuant to Article I, Section 2 of these By-Laws. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) by any stockholder of the corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this By-Law and who is a stockholder of record at the time such notice is delivered to the Secretary. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders if the stockholder delivers a notice in conformity with the procedures set forth for annual meetings in paragraph (a)(2) of this By-Law, provided that such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the seventieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.\\n\\n(c) General. (1) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.\\n\\n(2) For purposes of this By-Law, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\\n\\n6\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n(3) For purposes of this By-Law, no adjournment or notice of adjournment of any meeting shall be deemed to constitute a new notice of such meeting for purposes of this Section 11, and in order for any notification required to be delivered by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 11 to be timely, such notification must be delivered within the periods set forth above with respect to the originally scheduled meeting.\\n\\n(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law. Nothing in this By-Law shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.\\n\\nARTICLE II\\n\\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\\n\\nSection 1. The Board of Directors shall consist of such number of directors, not less than three, as shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by resolution of the Board of Directors. The directors shall be divided into three classes in the manner set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each class to be elected for the term set forth therein. Except as may be otherwise required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast (meaning the number of shares voted “for” a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted “against” such nominee) at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast (instead of by votes cast for or against a nominee) at any meeting at which a quorum is present for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice pursuant to these By-Laws that a stockholder intends to nominate a director or directors and (ii) such proposed nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the tenth day preceding the date the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. A majority of the total number of directors then in office (but not less than one-third of the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and, except as otherwise provided by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.\\n\\nSection 2. Newly created directorships in the Board of Directors that result from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and the directors so chosen shall hold office for a term as set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation. If any applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware expressly\\n\\n7\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nconfers power on stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent in voting power of all shares of the corporation that are issued and outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\\n\\nSection 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors or as may be specified in the notice of any meeting. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors and special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President, by oral or written notice, including, telegraph, telex or transmission of a telecopy, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission, duly served on or sent or mailed to each director to such director’s address or telecopy number as shown on the books of the corporation not less than one day before the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders at the same place at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board of Directors held at times fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting in person (except when the director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing.\\n\\nSection 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately by series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to Article SEVENTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless expressly provided by such terms. The number of directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock shall be in addition to the number fixed by or pursuant to these By-Laws. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the terms of such series, the number of directors that may be so elected by the holders of any such series of stock shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and without regard to the classification of the members of the Board of Directors as set forth in Article II, Section 1 of these By-Laws, and vacancies among directors so elected by the separate vote of the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors elected by such series, or, if there are no such remaining directors, by the holders of such series in the same manner in which such series initially elected a director.\\n\\n8\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSection 5. If at any meeting for the election of directors, the corporation has outstanding more than one class of stock, and one or more such classes or series thereof are entitled to vote separately as a class, and there shall be a quorum of only one such class or series of stock, that class or series of stock shall be entitled to elect its quota of directors notwithstanding the absence of a quorum of the other class or series of stock.\\n\\nSection 6. The Board of Directors may designate three or more directors to constitute an executive committee, one of whom shall be designated chairman of the executive committee. The members of the executive committee shall hold such office until the next election of the Board of Directors and until their successors are elected and qualify or until their earlier resignation or removal. Any vacancy occurring in the executive committee shall be filled by the Board of Directors. Regular meetings of the executive committee shall be held at such times and on such notice and at such places as it may from time to time determine. The executive committee shall act, advise with and aid the officers of the corporation in all matters concerning its interest and the management of its business, and shall generally perform such duties and exercise such powers as may from time to time be delegated to it by the Board of Directors, and shall have authority to exercise all the powers of the Board of Directors, so far as may be permitted by law, in the management of the business and the affairs of the corporation whenever the Board of Directors is not in session or whenever a quorum of the Board of Directors fails to attend any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. The executive committee shall have power to authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which are required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to have the seal affixed thereto. The fact that the executive committee has acted shall be conclusive evidence that the Board of Directors was not in session at such time or that a quorum of the Board of Directors had failed to attend the regular or special meeting thereof.\\n\\nThe executive committee shall keep regular minutes of its transactions and shall cause them to be recorded in a book kept in the office of the corporation designated for that purpose, and shall report the same to the Board of Directors at their regular meeting. The executive committee shall make and adopt its own rules for the governance thereof and may elect its own officers.\\n\\nSection 7. The Board of Directors may from time to time establish such other committees to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors which shall be comprised of such members of the Board of Directors and have such duties as the Board of Directors shall from time to time establish. Any director may belong to any number of committees of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. The Board of Directors may also \\n\\n9\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nestablish such other committees with such members (whether or not directors) and such duties as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.\\n\\nSection 8. Unless otherwise restricted by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or the committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or the committee, as the case may be.\\n\\nSection 9. The members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute presence in person at such a meeting.\\n\\nSection 10. The Board of Directors may establish policies for the compensation of directors and for the reimbursement of the expenses of directors, in each case, in connection with services provided by directors to the corporation.\\n\\nARTICLE III\\n\\nOFFICERS\\n\\nSection 1. The Board of Directors, as soon as may be after each annual meeting of the stockholders, shall elect a Chairman of the Board of Directors and officers of the corporation, including a Chief Executive Officer, a President and a Secretary. The Board of Directors may also from time to time elect such other officers (including one or more Vice Presidents, a Treasurer, one or more Assistant Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries and one or more Assistant Treasurers) as it may deem proper or may delegate to any elected officer of the corporation the power to appoint and remove any such other officers and to prescribe their respective terms of office, authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated Executive, Senior or Corporate, or may be given such other designation or combination of designations as the Board of Directors may determine. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person.\\n\\nSection 2. All officers of the corporation elected by the Board of Directors shall hold office for such term as may be determined by the Board of Directors or until their respective successors are chosen and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. Any officer may be removed from office at any time either with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors then in office, or, in the case of appointed officers, by any elected officer upon whom such power of removal shall have been conferred by the Board of Directors.\\n\\n10\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSection 3.

The Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President, as determined by the Board of Directors, shall be the Chief Executive Officer and shall have the general direction of the affairs of the corporation.\\n\\nSection 4. Unless otherwise provided in these By-Laws, in the absence or disability of any officer of the corporation, the Board of Directors may, during such period, delegate such officer’s powers and duties to any other officer or to any director and the person to whom such powers and duties are delegated shall, for the time being, hold such office.\\n\\nARTICLE IV\\n\\nCERTIFICATES OF STOCK\\n\\nSection 1. The shares of stock of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the corporation’s stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock of the corporation represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or as otherwise permitted by law, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.

Each person (and the heirs, executors and administrators of such person) who is or was a director and/or officer of the Company, whether elected or appointed (each such person being an “Indemnitee”), shall in accordance with Section 2 of this Article VI be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in effect on the date of amendment and restatement of these By-Laws, and to such greater extent as applicable law may thereafter permit, including against any and all losses, liabilities, costs, damages and reasonable expenses that may be paid or incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with or resulting from any actual or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether brought by or in the right of the Company or otherwise), civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, or in connection with an appeal relating thereto, in which such Indemnitee may become involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Indemnitee being or having been a director or officer of the Company or, if such Indemnitee shall be serving or shall have served in such capacity at the request of the Company, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity whether or not such Indemnitee continues to be such at the time such liability or expense shall have been paid or incurred, provided such Indemnitee acted, in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company and in addition, in criminal actions or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. As used in this ARTICLE VI, the terms, “liability” and “expense” shall include, but shall not be limited to, counsel fees and disbursements and amounts of judgments, fines or penalties against, and amounts paid in settlement by, such director or officer. The termination of any actual or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding, civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by judgment, settlement (whether with or without court approval), conviction or upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that such Indemnitee did not meet the standards of conduct set forth in this Section 1. \\n\\n12 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSection 2. Every Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under Section 1 of this ARTICLE VI with respect to any claim, action, suit or proceeding of the character described in such Section 1 in which he or she may become in any way involved as set forth in such Section 1, if (i) he or she has been wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in respect thereof, or (ii) the Board of Directors acting by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to (or who have been wholly successful with respect to) such claim, action, suit or proceeding, finds that such Indemnitee has met the standards of conduct set forth in such Section 1 with respect thereto, or (iii) a court determines that he or she has met such standards with respect thereto, or (iv) independent legal counsel (who may be the regular counsel of the Company) deliver to the Company their written advice that, in their opinion, he or she has met such standards with respect thereto. \\n\\nSection 3. For every such Indemnitee who has become or been threatened to become, a party to any actual or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding of any kind that might give right to such Indemnitee to indemnification under Section 1 of this Article VI (each, a “Matter”), the Company will advance all expenses reasonably incurred by or on behalf of that Indemnitee in connection with that Matter, provided that that Indemnitee shall have delivered an undertaking by or on behalf of that person to repay to the Company any expenses so advanced if it is ultimately determined that that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under that Section 1 in respect of those expenses. The Company will accept any such undertaking of any such Indemnitee without regard to the financial ability of such Indemnitee to make such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 3 will not require the Company to advance expenses with respect to any Matter initiated by or on behalf of any such Indemnitee against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether as an initial action or by counter or similar claim, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors. The provisions of this Section 3 shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of any person entitled to the benefits of this Section 3. No amendment to this Section 3, directly or by amendment to any other provision of these By-Laws, shall have any retroactive effect with respect to any Matter arising from or based on any act or omission to act by any person which occurs prior to the effectiveness of that amendment. \\n\\n13 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSection 4.

The rights of indemnification under this ARTICLE VI shall be in addition to any rights to which any such Indemnitee may otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law. \\n\\nSection 6. If any provision or provisions of this ARTICLE VI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this ARTICLE VI shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. \\n\\n14 \\nExhibit 3.1\\n\\n\\nof the  \\nArticles of Incorporation  \\nof  \\nITT Corporation\\n\\nThe undersigned officer of ITT Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the “Corporation”), existing pursuant to the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law as amended (hereinafter referred to as the “IBCL”), desiring to give notice of corporate action amending its Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, certifies the following facts: \\n\\nSection 1.

Written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting of shareholders, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, either personally, by mail, or by electronic transmission, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the President. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address as it appears on the stock transfer books or records of the corporation, or, if by facsimile telecommunication or electronic mail to a number or electronic mail address to which the shareholder has consented to receive such notices; as of the record date prescribed in Section 6 of this Article II, with postage thereon prepaid. When any shareholders’ meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for three days or more, notice of the \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nadjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. It shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of any meeting adjourned for less than three days or of the business to be transacted at the meeting, other than an announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken. Notice under this section may be given by electronic transmission if the shareholder authorizes delivery by electronic transmission, in advance, in writing and signed by the shareholder, submitted with information demonstrating that the shareholder authorized electronic submission.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 6. Fixing of Record Date. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors shall fix, in advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case shall be not more than 70 days, and in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 20 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the day before the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 7. Voting Lists. At least 20 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders shall be kept on file at the home office of the corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours, for a period of 20 days prior to such meeting. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book shall be prima facie evidence of the shareholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders. Failure to comply with the requirements of this bylaw shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 8. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present or represented at a meeting, a majority of those present or represented may transact any business that comes before the meeting, unless a greater percentage is required by law. If less than a quorum of the outstanding shares is represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified, and in the case of any adjourned meeting called for the election of directors, those who attend the second of the adjourned meetings, although less than a quorum, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 9\\\\. Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact, or by proxy executed \\n\\n2\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nby electronic transmission by the shareholder or by the authorized attorney-in-fact of the shareholder. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the Board of Directors. A proxy executed by electronic transmission must be directed to the person who will be the holder of the proxy and include information that demonstrates that such person was authorized by the shareholder as the holder of such proxy and to receive the transmission. All proxies shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation before or at the commencement of meetings. No proxy may be effectively revoked until notice in writing of such revocation has been given to the Secretary of the corporation by the shareholder (or his duly authorized attorney in fact, as the case may be) granting the proxy. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution unless it is coupled with an interest.\\n\\nSECTION 10. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by any officer, agent or proxy as the Bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such corporation may determine. A certified copy of a resolution adopted by such directors shall be conclusive as to their action.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nShares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nShares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority so to do is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIf shares are held jointly by three or more fiduciaries, the will of the majority of the fiduciaries shall control the manner of voting or giving of a proxy, unless the instrument or order appointing such fiduciaries otherwise directs.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nA shareholder, whose shares are pledged, shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter, the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nNeither treasury, shares of its own stock held by the corporation, nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation held by the corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 11. Voting. Every holder of outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at any meeting shall be entitled to the number of votes (if any) as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation. Shareholders shall not be entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, by statute, or by these Bylaws, a majority of those votes cast by shareholders at a lawful meeting shall be sufficient to pass on a transaction or matter.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSECTION 12. Informal Action by Shareholders. Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if consented to in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be given by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nARTICLE III\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nBoard of Directors\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 1.

Number, Term and Election. The Board of Directors shall consist of no less than seven (7) members and not more than fifteen (15). The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to or in the manner provided in these Bylaws, but shall be no less than and no more than the numbers set forth in the Articles of Incorporation. No decrease, however, shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director unless such director is removed in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws. Unless removed in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each director shall hold office until his successor shall have been elected and qualified.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 3. Regular Meetings. An annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this bylaw immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders, and at the same place as other regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors.

The President of the corporation, the Board of Directors or any director may call a special meeting of the Board. Regular meetings may be held in or out of the State of Alaska.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nMembers of the Board of Directors may participate in regular or special meetings by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Such participation shall constitute attendance in person, but shall not constitute attendance for the purpose of compensation pursuant to Section 13 of this Article.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 4. Notice of Special Meeting. Written notice of any special meeting shall be given to each director at least two days prior thereto. If mailed to the address at which the director is most likely to be reached, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. Any director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing filed with the Secretary. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. Special meetings may be held in or out of the state of Alaska.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSECTION 5. Quorum. A majority of the number of directors fixed by Section 2 of this Article III shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, but if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time. Notice of any adjourned meeting shall be given in the same manner as prescribed by Section 6 of this Article III.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 6. Manner of Acting. The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting or adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless a greater number is prescribed by these Bylaws.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 7. Action Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of the directors.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 8. Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by sending a written notice of such resignation to the principal office of the corporation addressed to the Chairman of the Board or the President. Unless otherwise specified therein, such resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Chairman of the Board or the President.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 9. Removal.

Members of either standing or special committees may be allowed such compensation for actual attendance at committee meetings as the Board of Directors may determine. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving remuneration therefor.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 12. Presumption of Assent. A director of the corporation who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on a corporation matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his dissent or abstention shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent to such action with the person acting as the Secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the corporation within five (5) days after the date he receives a copy of the minutes of the meeting.

A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary before the proxy is voted. Unless otherwise required by law, voting of stockholders for the election of directors need not be by written ballot.

Unless otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any other cause may be filled by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the vote of the sole remaining director.

The vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the vote of a greater number is required by law or the certificate of incorporation.

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a \"proceeding\"), by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an \"indemnitee\"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all reasonable expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\\' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee\\'s heirs, executors and administrators;  provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 7.2 below with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this ARTICLE VII shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an \"advancement of expenses\"); provided,  however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an \"undertaking\"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a \"final adjudication\") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this ARTICLE VII or otherwise. \\n\\nSection 7.2 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 7.1 above is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be thirty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that and (b) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its \\n\\n8\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nBoard of Directors, independent counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. \\n\\nSection 7.3 Non-Exclusivity of Rights under this ARTICLE. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this ARTICLE VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. \\n\\nSection 7.4 Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf or on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. \\n\\nSection 7.5 Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized at any time from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this ARTICLE VII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation. \\n\\nARTICLE VIII  \\nMISCELLANEOUS \\n\\nSection 8.1 Fiscal Year.

The Corporation may have a corporate seal which shall have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors. \\n\\nSection 8.3 Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and Committees. Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Unless otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice. \\n\\nSection 8.4 Interested Directors, Officers, Quorum. No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because \\n\\n9\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nhis or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (a) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (b) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (c) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction. \\n\\nSection 8.5 Books and Records. The books and records of the Corporation may be kept within or without the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs or any other information storage device provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect the same. \\n\\nSection 8.6 Amendment of Bylaws. These Bylaws may be amended or repealed, and new bylaws adopted, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders entitled to vote may adopt additional bylaws and may amend or repeal any by-law whether or not adopted by them. \\n\\n10\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\nQuickLinks  \\n\\n\\nEXHIBIT 3.3  \\n\\n\\nExhibit 3.1\\n\\n\\n\\nTO THE\\n\\nARTICLES OF INCORPORATION\\n\\nOF\\n\\nEVER-GLORY INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.\\n\\nPursuant to Sections 607.1003 and 607.1006 of the Business Corporation Act of the State of Florida, the undersigned Chief Executive Officer of Ever-Glory International, Inc.

The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers and authority for and on behalf of the Corporation as shall be permitted by law, the Restated Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws. \\n\\n2\\\\. The Board of Directors may hold their meetings within or outside of the State of Indiana, at such place or places as it may from time to time determine. \\n\\n3\\\\. The number of directors comprising the Board of Directors shall be such number as may be from time to time fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors. The directors shall be classified in respect to the time for which they shall severally hold office, by dividing them into three classes. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible. At each annual election, any vacancy in any class may be filled and the successors to the directors of the class whose terms shall expire in that year shall be elected to hold office for the term of three years, and the term of office of one class of directors shall expire in each year. In the event the number of directors is increased, election may be made to a class of directors with terms expiring in three years or less in order to maintain proportionate equality between the classes. \\n\\n4\\\\. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or any shareholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally. However, any shareholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such shareholder’s intent to make such nomination or nominations has been delivered personally to, or been mailed to and received by the Secretary of the Corporation at, the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than 50 days nor more than 75 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that, in the event that less than 65 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Each such notice shall set forth: (i) the name and address of the shareholder, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (ii) the class and number of shares of stock held of record, owned beneficially and represented by proxy by such shareholder as of the record date for the meeting (if such date shall then have been made publicly available) and of the date of such notice; (iii) a representation that the shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by such shareholder; (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had each nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated by the Board of Directors; and (vi) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if so elected. \\n\\n\\\\- 3 -\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\nNo person shall be eligible to serve as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-laws. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these By-laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. \\n\\n5\\\\. The directors shall be elected by the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on the election of directors, and directors shall be elected by a plurality vote. The directors shall be classified into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III as set forth in Section 3 of this Article IV. The Class I directors shall serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2005, the Class II directors until the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2006, and the Class III directors until the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2007 and, in each case, until their successor(s) are duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of shareholders commencing with the annual meeting to be held during the calendar year 2006 each of the successors to the Directors of the Class whose term shall have expired that year shall be elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires and until the successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. \\n\\n6\\\\. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled for the unexpired term by the concurring vote of a majority of the directors then in office, whether or not a quorum, and any director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such director’s successor shall have been elected and qualified. \\n\\n7\\\\. Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his resignation to the Board of Directors. Any such resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Board, or at such later date as may be specified therein. Any such notice to the Board shall be addressed to it in care of the Secretary. \\n\\n8\\\\. Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. \\n\\nARTICLE V  \\nCommittees Of Directors\\n\\n1\\\\. By resolutions adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, the Board may designate an Executive Committee and one or more other committees, each such committee to consist of one or more directors of the Corporation. The Executive Committee shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation (except as otherwise expressly limited by statute), including the power and authority to declare dividends and to authorize the issuance of stock, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Each such committee shall have such of the powers and authority of the Board as may be provided from time to time in resolutions adopted by a majority of the whole Board. \\n\\n2\\\\. The requirements with respect to the manner in which the Executive Committee and each such other committee shall hold meetings and take actions shall be set forth in the resolutions of the Board of Directors designating the Executive Committee or such other committee. \\n\\n\\\\- 4 -\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### \\n\\nARTICLE VI  \\nCompensation Of Directors\\n\\nThe directors shall receive such compensation for their services as may be authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors, which compensation may include an annual fee and a fixed sum for expense of attendance at regular or special meetings of the Board or any committee thereof.

Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all the members of the Board or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of committee. Any director may participate in a meeting of the Board, or any committee designated by the Board, by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this sentence shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. \\n\\nARTICLE VIII  \\nOfficers\\n\\n1\\\\.

Irrespective of the provisions of this Section 15, the Board of Directors may, at any time or from time to time, approve indemnification of directors, officers, employees or agents to the full extent permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law at the time in effect, whether on account of past or future actions or transactions.

The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making the decision, may consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance or the decision of the Board of Directors about his or her resignation. If the incumbent director’s resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director’s resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this By-Law, or if a nominee for director is not \\n\\n7\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nelected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a nominee for director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy at any meeting that includes the election of directors at which a quorum is present if, as of the 10th day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the shareholders of the Corporation, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a “Contested Election”), provided that with respect to any nominee proposed or nominated by a shareholder, the Secretary of the Corporation shall have received proper notice under Section 2 of this Article. For purposes of this Section, if plurality voting is applicable to the election of directors at any meeting, the nominees who receive the highest number of votes cast “for,” without regard to votes cast “against” or “withhold,” shall be elected as directors up to the total number of directors to be elected at that meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as a vote cast with respect to any election of directors.\\n\\nIn order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, such person must submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (i) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a\\n\\n4\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nContested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with the policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors for such purpose. If an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the Governance Committee shall recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board shall act on the resignation, taking into account the Governance Committee’s recommendation, and within 90 days after the date of certification of the election results, the Board shall disclose its decision and rationale regarding whether to accept the resignation (or the reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) in a press release, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or by other public announcement. The director whose resignation is under consideration may not participate in any deliberation or vote of the Governance Committee or Board of Directors regarding his or her resignation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that no nominee for director receives a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the members of the Governance Committee shall make a final determination as to whether the Board shall accept any or all resignations, including their own. The Governance Committee and the Board may consider any factors and other information they deem appropriate and relevant in deciding whether to accept a director’s resignation.\\n\\nIf an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for re-election in an election that is not a Contested Election and such director’s resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director will continue to serve until the expiration date of such director’s term in office or until such director’s earlier removal pursuant to Article II, Section 3 of these By-Laws. If such director’s resignation is accepted by the Board, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the\\n\\n5\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nnominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of these By-Laws.\\n\\nSECTION 9. Action Without a Meeting. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever the vote of shareholders is required or permitted in connection with any corporate action, that action may be taken without a meeting on written consent, setting forth the action so taken, signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.\\n\\nThe shareholder or shareholders proposing to take such action shall give notice of the proposed action, which notice shall be in writing and delivered to and received by the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation not less than ninety days before the proposed effective date of such action.\\n\\nARTICLE II  \\n  \\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\\n\\nSECTION 1. Function. The Board of Directors will manage the business of the Corporation, except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.\\n\\nSECTION 2. Number and Term of Office. The number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors will be such number, not less than three nor more than twenty, as is determined by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time, unless all the shares are owned beneficially and of record by less than three shareholders, in which event the number of directors fixed by resolution of the Board may be less than three but not less than the number of\\n\\n6\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nshareholders. As used in these By-Laws, “entire Board of Directors” means the total number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Article, the directors will be elected at the annual meetings of shareholders. The directors will be divided into classes and elected for terms as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.\\n\\nSECTION 3. Removal of Directors. Except as otherwise provided by law no director shall be removed prior to the expiration date of his term of office, as such date is defined in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, except for cause and by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors or of the holders of the percentage of outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote as is set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, cause for removal shall exist only if the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable for acts committed in bad faith or the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and such acts were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or acts in which he personally gained a financial profit or other advantage to which he was not legally entitled, or has been adjudicated mentally incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction.\\n\\nSECTION 4. Vacancies. Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and vacancies occurring in the Board may be filled by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum exists. Each director so elected will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders. Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and vacancies occurring in the Board also may be filled by the shareholders of the Corporation at the next annual meeting or any special meeting\\n\\n7\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\ncalled for the purpose, and each director so elected will hold office for the term provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.\\n\\nSECTION 5. Resignation. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice of his or her resignation to the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary of the Corporation. A resignation will take effect at the time specified in the notice or, if no time is specified, at the time the notice is given, and the acceptance of a resignation will not be necessary to make it effective.\\n\\nSECTION 6. Executive Committee and Other Committees. By the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board, the Board of Directors may designate from among its members an Executive Committee and other committees, each consisting of at least three members. The Executive Committee will have all the authority of the Board of Directors except as otherwise provided by Section 712 of the New York Business Corporation Law or other applicable statutes. Any other committees will have such authority as the Board of Directors may provide. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of the Executive Committee or any other committee to replace absent members. Members of all committees will serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.\\n\\nSECTION 7. Action by Unanimous Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all the members of the Board or the committee consent in writing to the adoption of a resolution authorizing the action. The resolution and the written consents by the members of the Board or committee shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or committee.\\n\\n8\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSECTION 8. Participation by Telephone. Any director may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee by conference telephone or similar communications equipment which allows all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other at the same time. Participation by that means will constitute presence in person at the meeting.\\n\\nARTICLE III\\n\\nMEETINGS OF DIRECTORS\\n\\nSECTION 1. First Meeting. The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors will be held immediately following each annual meeting of shareholders. If the meeting is held at the place of the meeting of shareholders, no notice of the meeting need be given to the newly elected directors. If the first meeting is not so held, it shall be held at a time and place specified in a notice given in the manner provided for notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors.\\n\\nSECTION 2. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held upon such notice, or without notice, at such places and at such times as may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors. If any day fixed for a regular meeting is a legal holiday at the place where the meeting is to be held, the meeting will be held at that place at the same hour on the next day which is not a legal holiday.\\n\\nSECTION 3. Special Meetings; Notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors will be held whenever called by the President, or by the Secretary at the written request of any two directors.

Waiver of Notice. Any person may waive notice of any meeting by signing a written waiver, whether before or after the meeting. In addition, attendance by a shareholder at a meeting in person or by proxy or attendance by a director at a meeting will be deemed a waiver of notice.

Indemnification — Third Party and Derivative Actions.\\n\\n> (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding (including, without limitation, one by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor), whether civil or criminal,\\n\\n14\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n> including an action by or in the right of any other Corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, which any director or officer of the Corporation served in any capacity at the request of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate, was a director or officer of the Corporation, or served such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise at the request of the Corporation in any capacity, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein, provided that no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of such person if (i) his or her acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of his or her active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to such action or proceedings or (ii) he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled.\\n> \\n> (b) The termination of any such civil or criminal action or proceeding by judgment, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that any such person did not act, in good faith, for a purpose which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or, in the case of service for any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation or that he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.\\n\\nSECTION 2. Other Indemnification. The Corporation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify or advance the expenses of any other person including agents and\\n\\n15\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nemployees to whom the Corporation is permitted by law to provide indemnification or advancement of expenses.\\n\\nSECTION 3. Payment of Expenses in Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law, the Corporation will advance to any person who may be entitled to indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 sums with which to pay expenses incurred by that person in defending against the claims, actions or proceedings for which such person may become entitled to indemnification, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay the sums which are advanced if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 to the extent the sums which are advanced exceed the indemnification to which such person is entitled.\\n\\nSECTION 4. Enforcement; Defenses. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the person in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within 60 days. Such person’s expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of expenses under Section 3 of this Article where the required undertaking has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has conducted himself or herself in a manner which would preclude the Corporation from indemnifying him or her pursuant to Sections 1 or 2 of this Article, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its shareholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances, nor the fact that there has been an\\n\\n16\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nactual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its shareholders) that indemnification of the claimant is not proper in the circumstances shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification.\\n\\nSECTION 5. Survival; Savings Clause; Preservation of Other Rights.\\n\\n> (a) The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each person who serves in such capacity at any time while these provisions are in effect, and any repeal or modification of the New York Business Corporation Law shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any action or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts, except as provided by law. Such a contract right may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such person, except as provided by law.\\n> \\n> (b) If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each person against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any actual or threatened action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, including any actual or threatened action by or in the right of the Corporation, or any appeal therein, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.\\n> \\n> (c) The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any other\\n\\n17\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n> by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The Corporation is hereby authorized to provide further indemnification if it deems advisable by resolution of shareholders or directors, by amendment of these by-laws or by agreement.\\n\\nSECTION 6. New York Business Corporation Law. All references to the New York Business Corporation Law in this Article IX shall mean such Law as it may from time to time be amended.\\n\\nSECTION 7. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify officers, directors and others against costs or liabilities incurred by them in connection with the performance of their duties and any activities undertaken by them for, or at the request of, the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law.\\n\\nARTICLE X  \\n  \\nSECURITY\\n\\nThe Board of Directors may require any officer, agent or employee to give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.\\n\\nARTICLE XI  \\n  \\nAMENDMENTS\\n\\nAny By-Law, including this Article XI, may be amended or repealed, in whole or in part, and new by-laws may be adopted, only (i) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of\\n\\n18\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nthe votes cast for such action, or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.\\n\\n19\\n\\n* * *\\n* * *\\n\\nExhibit 3.01\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nADOPTING\\n\\nAMENDED AND RESTATED\\n\\nARTICLES OF INCORPORATION\\n\\nOF\\n\\nXCEL ENERGY INC.\\n\\nThe undersigned, the Assistant Corporate Secretary of Xcel Energy Inc., a Minnesota corporation, hereby certifies that, in accordance with Chapter 302A of the Minnesota Statutes, the attached Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were approved by the Board of Directors and the requisite number of shares of the Corporation’s common stock at the Corporation’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 16, 2012.

To be timely, a shareholder’s notice shall be delivered or mailed to and received at the principal executive office of the corporation not less than 60 days prior to the date of the meeting, provided, however, that in the event that less than 70 days’ notice or prior disclosure of the date of this meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholders to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.

At the request of the board acting through the Governance Committee, any person nominated at the direction of the board by such committee for election as a director shall furnish to the corporate secretary that information required to be set forth in a shareholder’s notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.
