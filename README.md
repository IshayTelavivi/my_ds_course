### my_ds_course
---------
This is my first github repository! I made it following the tutorial video [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1702&v=SWYqp7iY_Tc).

My DS course has started on Dec 12 2017, and this repository stores my exercises and other related material.
Our first topic of the course was Python programming. The individual files were exercises we did on the first month of the course.
Later on we had the following 3 more extensive exercises to complete:
1. RSP Game (Rock Scissors Paper) - we were given detailed instructions about what the program should do and what the expected functionality should be. In the folder there is a PDF with the instructions and a jupyter notebook with the code.
2. Bunny Game - this was a really cool assignment. We were assigned to create a video game with graphics, motion and sound, using the python we had learned. The folder contains a jupyter notebook with the instructions, and a py file with the code. This was my first assignment done on a professional IDE (PyCharm). In adition there are several images and sound files that are used in the code.
3. Graphs Mini Project - a project that dealt with mathematical graphs and made use of classes. In addition it required learning of algorithms and implementing these in the code. In the folder there is a PDF with the instrucitons, a py file with the code, and a few additional data files.

The third topic of the course was Machine Learning. We started with classification and as aprt of the assignment we were assigned to create our own algorithm from scratch, to get more familiar with the algorithm and to practice our programming abilities. the file my_dt_algirithm contains my code.
