### my_ds_course
---------
This is my first github repository! I made it following the tutorial video [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1702&v=SWYqp7iY_Tc).

My DS course has started on Dec 12 2017, and this repository stores my exercises and other related material.
Our first topic of the course was python programming. The individual files were exercises we did on the first month of the course.
Later on we had the following 3 more extensive exercises to complete:
1. RSP Game (Rock Scissors Paper) - we were given detailed instructions about what the program should do and what the expected functionality should be. In the folder there is a PDF with the instructions and a jupyter notebook with the code.
2. Bunny Game - this was a really cool assignment. We were assigned to create a video game with graphics, motion and sound, using the python we had learned. The folder contains a jupyter notebook with the instructions, and a py file with the code. This was my first assignment done on a professional IDE (PyCharm). In adition there are several images and sound files that are used in the code.
3. Graphs Mini Project - a project that dealt with mathematical graphs and made use of classes. In addition it required learning of algorithms and implementing these in the code. In the folder there is a PDF with the instrucitons, a py file with the code, and a few additional data files.


The second topic was python tools, and it focused mainly on familiarization with numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries. In addition we explored other topics that my assist us such as web scraping, regular expression, file formats (json etc.) and others. The concluding mini project is within the Tools Mini Project folder:
* The project had two parts (as specified in the giudelines pdf), the first was scraping data from the internet, processing it in several aspects and then saving the data in a csv file. The second part was to perform some descriptive analyses, and this is located in a separarte notebook.


The third topic of the course was Machine Learning. We started with classification and as aprt of the assignments we were assigned to create our own algorithms for decition trees and K-NN from scratch, to get more familiar with the algorithms and to practice our programming abilities. The files my_dt_algirithm and my_knn_code contain the code for these assignments. Of course we learned and practiced clustering and regression models. The project for this phase was to complete a competition in Kaggle, my project is [here](https://github.com/IshayTelavivi/Kaggle---House-Prices-Competition).
